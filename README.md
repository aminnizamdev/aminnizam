# Amin Mohamad Nizam

Financial advisor with a focus on AI-assisted development in the crypto and automation space. I build bots, dashboards, and real-time tools using LLMs to streamline and scale trading, analysis, and system interactions.

My work is practical, fast-paced, and problem-oriented. With over 100 self-initiated projects completed since 2024, I specialize in rapid prototyping using tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok—integrating them with APIs, WebSocket streams, and structured bot frameworks.
